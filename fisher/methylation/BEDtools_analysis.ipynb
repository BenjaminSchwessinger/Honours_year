This is because the Tombo files consider all possible A and C sites in the genome, and provide some consistency between the 6mA and 5mC data. In contrast, Nanopolish only detects 5mC at CpG sites on the forward strand, and SMRTLink does not provide a methylation-call accuracy value that is comparable to the accuracy in Nanopolis and Tombo. While Nanopolish and Tombo use the fraction of reads for the site that are methylated, SMRTLink uses a Phred score to determine methylation-call accuracy."
