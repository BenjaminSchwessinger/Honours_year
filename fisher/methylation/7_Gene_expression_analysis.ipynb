    "While adenine methylation had high similarity between ONT and PB, cytosine methylation had only 44% similarity between NP and tombo. This is likely because NP only has CpG sites, and Tombo has all cytosine sites, so Tombo will detect far more potentially methylated sites, even those that are not CpG sites, so it will have far more sites than NP to begin with.\n",

Nanopolish has 71% CpG methylation, which is similar to the CpG methylation rate in mammals, which is 70-80% (Jabbari & Bernardi, 2004). Therefore, Nanopolish is likely to be more accurate than Tombo.\n",

This is because the Tombo files consider all possible A and C sites in the genome, and provide some consistency between the 6mA and 5mC data. In contrast, Nanopolish only detects 5mC at CpG sites on the forward strand, and SMRTLink does not provide a methylation-call accuracy value that is comparable to the accuracy in Nanopolis and Tombo. While Nanopolish and Tombo use the fraction of reads for the site that are methylated, SMRTLink uses a Phred score to determine methylation-call accuracy."
